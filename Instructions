Cant get around the password prompt in jupyter notebooks!!!

Open cmd and type jupyter notebook --generate-config. If it says Writing default config to: jupyter_notebook_config.py great!! Otherwise
Look for Anaconda3/Scripts folder and navigate to it using cmd (windows). For example in my case it was C:\Users\dell\Anaconda3\Scripts. This is the home directory.
Type jupyter notebook --generate-config. It should say Writing default config to: C:\Users\dell\.jupyter\jupyter_notebook_config.py.
Type jupyter notebook password. Enter password and verify it. It will show confirmation. Reload the page asking the password and enter the password you just created.
Viola!!
